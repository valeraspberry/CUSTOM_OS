# CUSTOM_OS
This is an OS I made with only one file in python. You can download apps from the internet if you want

NOTE THAT TO DOWNLOAD THINGS YOU NEED TO WRITE THIS:
GET [NAME OF THE APP].[EXTENSION]

IF YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD THINGS IN THE FIRST PLACE, YOU'LL NEED TO INSTALL THE PYTHON LIBRARY "requests" OTHERWISE IT'S GOING TO TELL YOU THAT requests ISN'T DEFINED. THE RUN COMMAND IS ENTIRELY VIRUS PROTECTIVE SO THAT THE HOST DEVIDE WON'T GET ARMED (the custom OS might still be harmed though)
